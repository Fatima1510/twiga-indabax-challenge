## Abstract
This chapter examined the alignment between the information prospective students gathered about the Open University of Tanzania (OUT) and their actual experiences. It identified the main sources through which students received first-hand information and analyzed the nature of this information in relation to OUT’s Open and Distance Learning (ODL) system. The chapter was developed through a literature review, case studies, and surveys. Data were collected using a questionnaire that included questions about academics, support services, and other important aspects of the university. The survey, conducted via Google Forms, involved 311 OUT students from various programs. Findings revealed that the OUT website was the primary source of information for prospective students, while other sources like radio, family members, career advisors, and TV commercials were rated much lower. Students reported receiving general information about OUT’s ODL model, but they expressed dissatisfaction with the information regarding the link between academic programs and career opportunities. Understanding these issues was essential for improving open, online, and distance learning and addressing barriers to successful ODL implementation. The chapter's findings contributed to refining marketing strategies and offered insights into future directions for ODL.

## Abstract
The chapter specifically identifies information sources students resort to for obtaining first-hand information about the Open University of Tanzania (OUT), analyzing the nature of information in relation to admission, academic, and support issues within the context of Open and Distance Learning (ODL) systems. The specific objectives presented in the establishment of intentional opportunities for a holistic student experience were determined through the findings. This chapter seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of whether the information disseminated about OUT accurately reflects the lived reality within its academic and administrative spheres. The chapter contributes to the body of knowledge in marketing and fills the gap in the reality of the information provided by OUT in overcoming barriers in the successful implementation of ODL.

## 1. Introduction
The chapter discusses the findings of each objective, as well as the implications and conclusions. It aims to unearth findings that have the potential to contribute to the completion of future educational institutions and improve the clarity of the narratives that surround them.

## 2. Concept and Definition
### 2.1 First-Hand Information
The term first-hand information refers to insights or information obtained directly from a primary source when prospective students gather information to decide on the choice of university to study.

### 2.2 Information Search
The term Information Search is considered a means used by consumers to reduce uncertainty and perceived risk (Urbany et al., 1989; Cox, 1967). In this context, consumers are prospective students seeking information to study at OUT. Information search can be internal or external (Blackwell et al., 2006):
- **Internal Search**: Based on retrieving existing information in memory or knowledge from previous related experiences.
- **External Search**: Refers to collecting new information from various personal and non-personal sources.

### 2.3 Sustainable Education
Sustainable education involves active academic participation to create economic, social, and environmental programs that improve life standards, generating empowerment and respecting interdependence (Tavanti and Wilp, 2015). It aims to instill in students, schools, and communities the values and motivations to act for sustainability now and in the future (Tyagi and Verma, 2022).

# Background of the Chapter

## Introduction
Every prospective student requires access to valuable information that will assist in determining their choice for higher learning. It is customary and anticipated for students to actively pursue information in order to narrow down their options and choose an institution that aligns with their expectations and interests. In light of the present and continuous evolution of the university marketplace, its operational methods, and the consequences for both students and universities, careful consideration is given to the crucial matter of whether first-hand information accurately represents the experience and satisfaction of the students. The prevailing assumption is that first-hand information consistently possesses a significant level of integrity, dependability, and accuracy.

Moreover, higher education institutions, including OUT, have an essential role in sustainability (Žalėnienė and Pereira, 2021). Wals (2014) indicates that the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (UNDESD) emphasizes the importance of education in increasing world sustainability. One of the objectives of UNDESD is "to integrate the principles, values and practices of sustainable development into all aspects of education and learning." Sustainability principles need to be at the heart of higher institutions' strategy and are key to being incorporated into the organisational culture. Higher education contributes decisively to the Sustainable Development Goals implementation, especially to Goal 1 (end poverty in all its forms everywhere), Goal 3 (ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages), Goal 5 (gender equality), Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth), Goal 12 (responsible consumption and production), Goal 13 (climate change), and Goal 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). In light of this context, the first-hand information that the OUT provides to potential students should be pertinent in addressing challenges associated with sustainable development.

Sterling (2001) poses two fundamental enquiries regarding sustainable education: "What is the purpose of education?" and "Whose Education?" Starting with the first question, this is all about the purpose of education: to replicate society and culture and promote citizenship (socialisation function); to train people for employment (vocational function); to develop the individual and their potential (liberal function); and to encourage change towards a fairer society and better world (transformative function). Another question is about "whose education"? Education seeks to place ownership and determination with educators, learners, and communities. Learners should have ownership of their learning, and education has to be meaningful, engaging, and participative rather than functional, passive, and prescriptive.

# Significance of First-Hand Information in Enabling Prospective Students to Access Sustainable Education for Successful Open, Online, and Distance Learning (ODL)

## Abstract
The choice of which university to attend is a complex decision influenced by multiple factors. This paper explores the significance of first-hand information in aiding prospective students in making informed decisions regarding their education, particularly in the context of Open, Online, and Distance Learning (ODL).

## 1. Introduction
The decision-making process for prospective students regarding university selection is characterized by complexity and uncertainty. According to Briggs and Wilson (2007), complete information about an institution enhances the ability of prospective students to make informed educational choices. McNicholas (2020) emphasizes that information seeking is a critical factor influencing students' decisions to attend any university.

## 2. Methodology
This study employs a qualitative approach to analyze the information-seeking behavior of prospective students. The Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) is utilized to understand how information gathering reduces uncertainty in decision-making.

## 3. Results
### 3.1 Information Gathering and Decision-Making
Prospective students actively seek first-hand information to gain a transparent and accurate depiction of university life. This information collection process is essential in reducing uncertainty, as supported by Cognitive Dissonance Theory (Spink and Cole, 2004). Blythe (2013) identifies four types of perceived risk that motivate prospective students to gather information before making a decision:

- Psychosocial Risk
- Financial Risk
- Physical Risk
- Functional Risk

#### Figure 1: Information Gathering Risks Reduction and Decision-Making Processes
*Adapted from McNicholas (2020).*

!Figure 1

### 3.2 Anxiety Reduction in University Selection
The decision of which university to attend and which course to pursue is a challenging task for prospective students. Ürer et al. (2021) note that students seek information to alleviate the anxiety associated with choosing a higher education institution. Information searching is recognized as a consumer behavior, where prospective students are viewed as consumers (Urbany et al., 1989; Cox, 1967). Kotler and Fox (1995) define information searching as the second stage in the decision-making process.

## 4. Discussion
The findings indicate that first-hand information plays a crucial role in reducing perceived risks and uncertainties faced by prospective students. The insights gained from this study can inform universities on how to better support students in their decision-making processes.

## 5. Conclusion
In conclusion, the significance of first-hand information in the decision-making process for prospective students cannot be overstated. By understanding the types of risks involved and the role of information seeking, educational institutions can enhance their outreach and support strategies for prospective students.

# Research Paper Title

## Abstract
*The abstract section would typically summarize the key findings and significance of the research. This section is currently not provided.*

## 1. Introduction
The first stage is Needs Recognition, which encompasses the selection of an institution, motivation to study, and information selection. After conducting an information search, the subsequent phase is the "Evaluation Process," which entails the selection of an institution. In general, the higher the degree of perceived risk, the higher the tendency to look for information about a service (Murray, 1991). Once the need to study at the university level has been recognized, a student usually searches for information on how to satisfy this need. Students typically start the search process from their memory of alternative institutions that might be able to satisfy their needs.

*The methodology section would typically describe the research design, data collection methods, and analysis techniques. This section is currently not provided.*

## 3. Results
### 3.1 The Open University of Tanzania, Information Dissemination and Marketing
As illustrated in **Figure 2**, the Open University of Tanzania (OUT) admits students to a variety of programs at different levels, including PhDs, Masters', Postgraduate Diplomas, Bachelor's degrees, Diplomas, and certificates. The figure shows undergraduate admission on an annual basis from 2017/2018 to 2021/2022. The admission trend indicates an increase in student enrollment throughout five years. However, there was a slight decrease in student admission in 2019/2020.

Moreover, the regional centres are staffed by marketing officers who work under the Communication and Marketing Department to promote the OUT programs and ensure that the institution attracts students to study each year. They also provide information about OUT, the programs offered, academic issues, school fees, and OUT-ODL during the marketing process. Additionally, the marketing officers respond to inquiries that arise during the marketing procedure. The dissemination of information is also contingent upon the demographic that is being targeted.

# METHODOLOGY

A questionnaire was developed through Google Forms, which captured the specific objectives regarding the information about OUT. A total of 311 students currently enrolled at OUT responded to a questionnaire online. The questionnaire contained information regarding first-hand information sources in which students were required to indicate an option of their favour. The students were also provided with statements on issues related to academics, supporting services, and related matters, as well as issues regarding the OUT as an ODL institution. The statements were rated using five levels of the Likert scale in search of students' agreement on the information provided.

In order to analyse data, Microsoft Excel was implemented. The obtained information from the questionnaire was loaded to the Excel sheet, percentages were computed for gender, age, and sources of information regarding the OUT. Additionally, the percentages were also calculated for the statements concerning the actuality of OUT, along with Likert scale levels. Subsequently, bar charts were implemented to visually represent the findings.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

This part of the book chapter presents the results on gender and age of the students who participated in the study. Also, the section presents results regarding sources for first-hand information, nature of the first-hand information about the University, and first-hand information about OUT and the mode of study.

The data presented in **Figure 3** demonstrates that a sizeable proportion of the individuals who participated in this book chapter were male.

| Gender          | Percentage |
|-----------------|------------|
| Male            | 70.70%     |
| Female          | 29.30%     |

*The introduction section would provide background information and the rationale for the study.*

## 2. Methodology
*The methodology section would detail the research design, participants, and data collection methods.*

## 3. Results
### 3.1 Demographics of Respondents
Figure 3 shows that the majority of respondents to the questionnaire were aged 25-34 (53.4%) and 35-44 (36.3%). The results revealed that individuals who enroll in the University fall within the age range of 25 to 44 years. Moreover, there are few individuals aged 45 and above.

The students who participated in the development of this chapter presented the faculties and directorates of the OUT. Students from the faculty of education accounted for 39.1%, the faculty of law 5.8%, the faculty of arts and social sciences 33.3%, the faculty of science 9.2%, and the Institute of Continuing Education (ICE) 12.6%.

Out of the 311 responses:
- 11.7% were from master's programs
- 60.9% were from first degrees
- 14.8% were from diplomas
- 9.1% were from certificates
- 3.5% were from postgraduate diplomas

Students were also from different academic years, whereby:
- 35.1% were in their first year of study
- 31.2% were in their second year
- 29.9% were in their third year
- 1.3% were in their fourth year
- 0.9% were in their fifth year
- 0.9% were in their sixth year
- 0.9% were in their seventh year

## 4. Sources for First-Hand Information
This section identifies key information sources that students visited when they decided to study with the OUT. It is imperative to comprehend the significance of first-hand sources when investigating the manner in which prospective students acquire information about universities.

Kotler (2008), as indicated in Figure 4, divides these external information sources into two categories: personal and non-personal. Non-personal sources consist of advertisements, prospectuses, and mass media, while personal sources include advice from family, friends, and instructors.

Non-personal sources comprise more formal methods of information dissemination, including promotional materials and official university websites. Information sources have been classified as impersonal and personal (Patti and Chen, 2009), direct, media, and social (Bonnema &#x26; van der Waldt, 2008), or online and offline (Patti and Chen, 2009; Dao &#x26; Thorpe, 2015).

The information sources illustrate students' direct methods of gathering information regarding their prospective educational institutions. These sources provide valuable, intimate insights and can have a substantial impact on the decision-making process of a prospective student. By integrating these diverse sources of information, prospective students can achieve a more nuanced understanding of what a university has to offer, enabling them to make well-informed decisions about their educational paths.

Thus, students have access to a variety of information sources from which they can obtain first-hand information before deciding whether or not to pursue higher education at a certain institution, as illustrated in Figure 4.

## 3. Results
### 3.1 Information Sources
Figure 5 indicates the information sources students visited prior to studying with the OUT. The findings of this chapter reveal that prospective students mostly use the website (40%) to search for information about OUT in order to decide whether or not to pursue further education. Moreover, the findings revealed other sources of information prospective students rely on, including:
- OUT prospectus: 20.40%
- From a friend: 20%

However, the findings also revealed that some sources of information are rarely visited, such as:
- Career advisors: 1%
- OUT regional centre: 2%
- Radio: 5.3%
- TV commercials: 5.3%
- Family members: 6%

This was a surprising finding.

## 4. Discussion
### 4.1 Nature of the First-Hand Information about the University
It is of the utmost importance to provide prospective students with accurate and relevant information pertaining to the University. Prospective students are always on the lookout for detailed university information so they may make educated decisions. They do not simply accept the information; they evaluate its relevance in relation to their circumstances, personal objectives, and values (Lubbe and Petzer, 2013).

The quality and scope of this information can vary substantially depending on the sources queried and the individual's background, which may include personal experiences and prior knowledge. The information provided about a university must be comprehensive and detailed despite these variations. A comprehensive presentation of information assists candidates in making well-informed decisions regarding their academic future and addresses knowledge deficits.

In this chapter, students at the Open University of Tanzania have exhibited specific insights into the quality and nature of the information that has been presented to them. The students were provided with statements which showed the quality of the information about OUT.

### 4.1 First-hand Information about OUT and the Mode of Study
The Open University of Tanzania is distinguished by its emphasis on Open and Distance Learning (ODL) and its distinctive educational approach within the country. Its flexibility and accessibility are the distinguishing characteristics of Open and Distance Learning (ODL). ODL is an optimal option for students who are unable to attend traditional classroom settings due to personal, professional, or geographical obligations, as it enables them to study from virtually any location and at any time. In order to facilitate education, this method frequently employs online platforms, printed materials, and intermittent in-person interactions. The focus is on self-directed learning, in which students are empowered to manage their schedules and progress with the assistance of digital resources and remote tutoring.

## 2. Methodology
*The methodology section is not provided in the current text.*

## 3. Results
For each of the six statements concerning the OUT form of study, the students were found to agree, as shown in **Figure 6**. During the process of deciding whether or not to study with the OUT, it has been discovered that the sources of information that students utilize contain information on the characteristics of the online distance learning (ODL) style of study.

## 4. Discussion
Students expect that the information they are provided regarding the University is both accurate and indicative of their future experiences upon enrolment. Universities must ensure that the information they disseminate is both authentic and comprehensive, thereby fostering an environment that aligns with students' expectations. The information that is collected is contingent upon the information sources that are accessible to prospective students.

The website serves as the primary source of information for the Open University. The OUT Information and Communication Technology Policy 2019/20 to 2023/24 is substantiated by the results (OUT, 2019). One of the policy objectives is to guarantee that the website content is intended to provide users with pertinent and up-to-date information. The policy suggests that the university website has been improved to include all pertinent information for both current and prospective students. Additionally, the website has integrated a live support feature for students.

The University maintains a website that serves as both a communication and marketing instrument. Effectively presenting, useful, and timely updating of the information is guaranteed by the appropriate organization of the website's content. Given the information, the OUT website had valuable and relevant information, information that prospective students are satisfied with and built high expectations and hence chose to study at OUT.

The findings are related to a study by Ürer, Erdil, Tümer, Nadiri, and Aghaei (2021) at the University of North Cyprus. In a case by Paddy (2019), regarding the international students at the University of Ghana (n = 166) and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (n = 269), family members are the main sources of information about the universities in both, followed by the institution's website. Another case is by Mwidege and Matimbwa (2023) at Mbeya University of Science and Technology (MUST) in Tanzania. Students relied on the National Council for Technical Education - Vocational Education and Training to get their information, followed by friends and the MUST website, with mass media being the last.

The first-hand information regarding the nature of the general information to the prospective students reflects the reality of OUT. The important information on academic and support issues provided by the OUT to...

# Unlocking Sustainable Education through Open, Online, and Distance Learning

## Abstract
This chapter examines the role of first-hand information about the Open University of Tanzania (OUT) in facilitating access to education for prospective students. It highlights the importance of clear and reliable information in the decision-making process for students considering Open and Distance Learning (ODL) as a mode of study.

## 1. Introduction
Prospective students' information is crucial when deciding to study with OUT. Clear information unlocks sustainable education as it allows students to choose courses that align with their career goals. However, the information regarding the link between academic issues and career opportunities is often unsatisfactory. Bae (2022) noted the importance of this relationship in meeting students' needs.

## 2. Methodology
The chapter utilizes qualitative analysis to assess the information provided by OUT and its impact on prospective students. It examines the characteristics of OUT's ODL method and the challenges faced by students, particularly in rural areas.

## 3. Results
### 3.1 Characteristics of ODL
The characteristics of OUT's ODL method are well-known to potential students, which aids in their decision-making process. Awareness of these characteristics helps mitigate challenges faced by students in ODL.

### 3.2 Challenges Faced by Students
Edward (2019) identified issues such as limited study places and unstable electricity that rural ODL students encounter. These challenges can disrupt concentration and engagement with course material, exacerbating the digital divide and impacting academic success.

## 4. Discussion
### 4.1 Implications of the Findings
The findings indicate that the OUT website serves as the primary source of information for prospective students, emphasizing its critical role in accessibility to education. The chapter provides essential knowledge about the sources of information commonly used to learn about OUT, which reflects the reality of the institution regarding application processes, admission choices, and the ODL mode of study.

### 4.2 Importance of Reliable Information
Prioritizing accessible and reliable information minimizes barriers to successful ODL implementation. It meets the needs of applicants and provides a clear understanding of the academic journey at OUT. If first-hand information does not accurately reflect OUT programs, it may hinder institutional development by limiting student enrollment and negatively affecting the university's reputation.

## 5. Conclusion
This chapter underscores the significance of first-hand information in shaping the perceptions and decisions of prospective students regarding OUT. The quality of information provided can influence the institution's development and its ability to attract students, thereby impacting the overall effectiveness of ODL.

# CONCLUSION
The purpose of this chapter is to analyse whether or not first-hand information may be applied to the actual situation of OUT. In this chapter, the OUT website is the central source of information. Nevertheless, the reality of OUT is represented in the nature of the general information about OUT, which is comparable to that of other institutions; however, the nature of the first-hand information should not be the end of information that distinguishes OUT as an online and distance learning institution.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
The OUT website and other information sources should be improved periodically to include information regarding the link to academic issues, career opportunities, and goals that show not satisfying the prospective students' needs.

Other sources of information that have been rated low have to be examined to see if the information contained in or provided, like those from regional centres and TV commercials, suffice the needs and expectations of the prospective students towards the choice to study at the OUT. A study needs to be conducted to identify the information deficiencies in the sources that hinder prospective students' engagement in deciding to enrol at the OUT.
