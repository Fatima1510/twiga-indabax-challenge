# The Konse Group on the SE margin of the Tanzania Craton − a Paleoproterozoic passive margin succession of the Usagaran Orogen: Constraints from metamorphic monazite ages and isotopic studies

## Abstract
The Konse Group, located on the southeastern margin of the Tanzania Craton, represents a significant Paleoproterozoic passive margin succession associated with the Usagaran Orogen. This study presents new data on metamorphic monazite ages and isotopic compositions, providing insights into the tectonic evolution and geological history of the region. The findings suggest a complex interplay of tectonic processes during the formation of the Konse Group, with implications for understanding the broader geological framework of the East African region.

## 1. Introduction
The Tanzania Craton is a key geological feature in East Africa, characterized by its ancient rock formations and complex tectonic history. The Konse Group, situated on its southeastern margin, is of particular interest due to its potential to reveal insights into the Paleoproterozoic era. This paper aims to investigate the metamorphic history of the Konse Group through the analysis of monazite ages and isotopic data, contributing to the understanding of the Usagaran Orogeny.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Sample Collection
Samples were collected from various locations within the Konse Group, focusing on areas with well-preserved metamorphic rocks.

### 2.2 Analytical Techniques
Monazite ages were determined using U-Pb isotopic dating methods, while isotopic compositions were analyzed through mass spectrometry.

### 2.3 Data Interpretation
The data were interpreted in the context of regional tectonics and compared with existing geological models of the Usagaran Orogen.

## 3. Results
### 3.1 Monazite Age Data
The U-Pb dating of monazite yielded ages ranging from 1.8 to 2.0 Ga, indicating significant metamorphic events during the Paleoproterozoic.

### 3.2 Isotopic Compositions
Isotopic analyses revealed variations in oxygen and carbon isotopes, suggesting diverse metamorphic conditions and fluid interactions.

## 4. Discussion
The results indicate that the Konse Group experienced multiple metamorphic events, likely related to tectonic processes associated with the Usagaran Orogeny. The age data align with known tectonic events in the region, supporting the hypothesis of a complex geological history influenced by both passive margin development and subsequent orogenic activity.

## 5. Conclusion
This study enhances the understanding of the Konse Group's geological history and its role within the broader context of the Tanzania Craton. The findings underscore the importance of integrating isotopic and age data to unravel the complexities of ancient tectonic processes.

### A B S T R A C T
The Konse Group is a 2–3 km thick succession of quartzites, metaconglomerates, micaschists, marbles, Mn-rich metasediments, and mafic metavolcanics deposited over >200 km in a narrow basin along the SE margin of the Archean Tanzania Craton. The timing of basin formation with respect to the Paleoproterozoic Usagaran orogeny is controversial: it is interpreted either as post-orogenic, overlying folded Usagaran gneisses, or as pre-orogenic, developed on the craton margin. In the latter case, the Konse Group is regarded as a lower-grade, time equivalent of the tectonically overlying Usagaran gneisses, which represent the deeper part of the same basin. Nearly U-free monazite from oxidized Mn3+-rich Konse Group micaschists yielded a Th-Pb age of 2028 ± 15 Ma (95 % confidence) for metamorphism, which argues against a post-orogenic depositional age. The low U content and Mn3+-enrichment are attributed to oxidizing conditions in the precursor sediment. The pre-Usagaran depositional age is supported by highly positive δ13C values, +12.6 and +9.3 ‰, for marbles of the Konse Group and correlative Mpwapwa Group to the northeast, respectively, indicating sedimentation during the ca. 2.22–2.06 Ga Lomagundi Event. Both groups share a similar depositional age and tectonic setting with marginal successions of other southeastern African cratons, which were deposited at early stages during the assembly of the Paleoproterozoic Columbia/Nuna supercontinent. The Konse and Mpwapwa groups represent cratonic passive margin successions, which belong to the Usagaran Orogen. The latter contains essential lithological members of a Wilson cycle, suggesting that modern-style plate tectonics operated during the Paleoproterozoic.

### 1. Introduction
The Proterozoic Konse Group (KG) of central Tanzania is a volcano-sedimentary succession, which occurs in a narrow basin developed over more than 200 km along the SE border of the Neoarchean Tanzania Craton (Grantham, 1927; Whittingham, 1959; Meinhold, 1970; Meinhold and Frisch, 1970; Mruma, 1989, 1995). It consists of a 2–3 km thick succession of quartzites, metaconglomerates, greenschists, amphibolites, micaschists, graphite-muscovite schists, iron-rich quartzites, some minor, oxidized Mn3+-silicate bearing micaschists, and Mn-rich quartzites, besides some dolomite and calcite marbles (Meinhold, 1970). The succession shows a W-E metamorphic zonation with (sub-) greenschist facies grade in the west, near the craton, and lower amphibolite facies (Hbl ± Grt; mineral abbreviations after Whitney and Evans, 2010) further east (cf. Meinhold, 1970), and, like many other early Precambrian sedimentary basins, the KG lacks biostratigraphic age information. The Group’s assumed age and basin-type, which are based on stratigraphic correlations with adjoining units, are therefore ambiguous and resulted in contrasting interpretations.

Indirect age constraints are based on the observation that the KG on its eastern side is bordered by high-grade gneisses of the Paleoproterozoic Usagaran Orogen. These gneisses of the Lower Isimani Group have been thrust during the Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic orogenic events towards the Tanzania Craton and now overlie the low-grade Konse Group.

## Abstract
The study investigates the geological setting and age constraints of the Konse Group (KG) in Tanzania, focusing on its correlation with the Mpwapwa Group and the implications for the Paleoproterozoic orogenic belts. The research employs monazite geochronology and carbon isotopic chemostratigraphy to establish the depositional age and tectonic setting of the KG, revealing significant insights into the evolution of the Tanzania Craton.

## 1. Introduction
The geological history of the Tanzania Craton is marked by complex interactions between various orogenic belts, particularly during the Paleoproterozoic era. The Konse Group, situated near the southern termination of the KG basin, is characterized by intermediate to felsic volcanic rocks that unconformably overlie folded Usagaran gneisses. Previous studies have suggested a correlation between the Mpwapwa Group and the Konse Group, prompting further investigation into their depositional ages and tectonic implications.

## 2. Geological Setting of Paleoproterozoic Orogenic Belts in Tanzania
### 2.1 Overview
The Paleoproterozoic orogenic belts of Tanzania encircle the Archean Tanzania Craton, with the Ubendian Belt to the southwest and the Usagaran Belt to the southeast. The crust of the Tanzania Craton primarily formed during the Neoarchean, with older rocks also identified. These orogenic belts contain eclogites formed from ocean-floor basalts during metamorphic events dated at approximately 2.0 Ga in the Usagaran Belt and 1.88–1.86 Ga in the Ubendian Belt.

### 2.2 Tectonic Interpretations
Contrasting interpretations regarding the KG's depositional environment have emerged, with some researchers suggesting a pre-orogenic temporal equivalent to the Lower Isimani Group, while others propose a post-orogenic interpretation. The current study aims to clarify these interpretations through direct age constraints and isotopic analyses.

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1 Monazite Geochronology
Monazite geochronology was employed to determine the metamorphic ages of spessartine-Mn3+-andalusite micaschists from Mhumbirisa Hill, which are representative of the KG. This method provides critical insights into the timing of metamorphism and the tectonic evolution of the region.

### 3.2 Carbon Isotope Chemostratigraphy
Carbon isotopic chemostratigraphy was applied to the widespread marbles of the KG to further constrain its possible depositional age. The presence of the Lomagundi Carbon Isotope Excursion (LCIE) serves as a global chemostratigraphic marker for correlating poorly dated Paleoproterozoic sedimentary successions.

## 4. Results
The analyses revealed that the KG underwent metamorphism during the Paleoproterozoic, with evidence of a weak Neoproterozoic overprint. The isotopic compositions of the Konse marbles suggest a correlation with the Lomagundi Event, indicating a significant period of carbon cycling and crustal growth.

## 5. Discussion
The findings support the hypothesis that the KG represents a passive margin succession rather than a post-orogenic deposit. The similarities between the KG and the Mpwapwa Group, along with the new metamorphic ages, provide a clearer understanding of the tectonic processes that shaped the region during the Paleoproterozoic.

## 6. Conclusion
This study establishes critical age constraints for the Konse Group and elucidates its geological significance within the context of the Paleoproterozoic orogenic belts in Tanzania. The integration of monazite geochronology and carbon isotopic chemostratigraphy offers valuable insights into the tectonic evolution of the Tanzania Craton.

The Mpwapwa Group metasediments are correlative to those of the Konse Group. Close to the craton, they were mainly metamorphosed during the Usagaran orogeny, further east at the Mautia Hill by the Kuunga collisional event at ca. 550 Ma, and in the south (Kilosa) during both events.

The Konse Group of the Usagaran orogen was deposited during the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion at ca. 2.22–2.06 Ga at the margin of the Archean Tanzania Craton and was metamorphosed during the Usagaran orogeny at ca. 2.0 Ga. The group is overlain by a Paleoproterozoic nappe pile: The Lower Ismani Group (accretionary wedge sediments) envelopes a belt of subduction-related retrogressed eclogites and is overlain by a nappe of the ca. 2.06 Ga low-pressure granulites (Upper Ismani Group) interpreted to be derived from a 50–60 Myr older low-P/high-T paired metamorphic belt to the east. It was emplaced by NW-directed transport (in today’s coordinates) during the Usagaran orogeny at ca. 2.0 Ga.

### 3.1 Stratigraphic Columns
Figure 3 presents two stratigraphic columns of the Konse Group of the Usagaran Orogen drawn after geological sections published by Meinhold (1970): the Great Ruaha River section in the NE and the Mhumbirisa Hill section in the SW. The thickness of the Konse Group was estimated by Meinhold (1970) at 2–3 km. The metamorphism of the marked horizon of Mn-rich micaschist (Mhumbirisa Hill; black star) was dated with monazite, and the marked marble horizons (blue stars) were analyzed for C and O isotope ratios.

### 3.2 Carbon Isotope Data
Plot of δ18Ocarb vs. δ13Ccarb for the Konse Group marbles of the Usagaran Orogen, Tanzania. Sample locations are shown in Figure 2. The Mautia Hill marbles of the Mpwapwa Group, associated with oxidized whiteschists, experienced a high-P amphibolite-facies metamorphism during the ca. 550 Ma Kunnga collisional event. A Paleoproterozoic metamorphism has not been recognized so far at the Mautia Hill. However, the highly oxidized Mn-rich rock association resembles that of the Konse Group at the Mhumbirisa Hill. The herein reported carbon isotope data support this correlation and point to a Paleoproterozoic depositional age during the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion at ca. 2.22–2.06 Ga.

## 4. Discussion
The findings align with previous studies by many authors regarding the ‘Western Granulites’ (e.g., Sommer et al., 2003, 2005a, 2017; Pinna et al., 1993; Fritz et al., 2005, 2013; Tenczer et al., 2013; Thomas et al., 2013, 2016; Hauzenberger et al., 2014), which are thought to have been affected by a Neoproterozoic (Kuunga) granulite-facies metamorphism. However, a granulite-facies metamorphism of the Kuunga age (ca. 550 Ma) has so far not been demonstrated. Instead, the study of whiteschist metamorphism of the Mpwapwa Group in the ‘Western Granulites’ at the Mautia Hill resulted in a P-T path pointing to substantial Neoproterozoic tectonic crustal thickening at ca. 550 Ma. The peak of metamorphism was at high-P amphibolite-facies conditions (Jons and Schenk, 2004).

The eastern boundary of the Paleoproterozoic Usagaran Belt within the Neoproterozoic Mozambique Belt is obscured (and thus uncertain) due to the strong Neoproterozoic reworking of pre-existing older crust. However, taking the distribution of published Paleoproterozoic formation ages as evidence for the extent of the Paleoproterozoic orogeny in the Mozambique Belt and adding new metamorphic monazite ages, we considerably expanded the hitherto assumed regional extent of the Usagaran Orogen towards N and NE as shown in Figure 1 (up to Itiso in the north and including the Mpwapwa Group exposed in the Kiboriani Mountains).

Monazite grains included in garnet porphyroblasts of the Mpwapwa Group metapelites at the Kiboriani Mountains (e.g., at Kilosa in Figure 1) yielded Paleoproterozoic ages (1956 ± 13 Ma), whereas ages of monazite grains in the matrix reflect the Neoproterozoic reworking (583 ± 10 Ma). This can be taken as evidence that the main metamorphic event that affected these rocks (resulting in growth of garnet porphyroblasts) is of Paleoproterozoic age, whereas the Neoproterozoic reworking was of minor importance.

## 5. Conclusion
In summary, the new geochronological data reveal that the Mpwapwa Group metasediments, which occur along the eastern margin of the Tanzania Craton between Itiso and the Great Ruaha River (southern area of the so-called ‘Western Granulites’), are part of the Usagaran Belt. They were affected by an upper amphibolite-facies metamorphism in the Paleoproterozoic, at ca. 2.0–1.96 Ga, and can be regarded as a time equivalent to the metasediments of the Konse and Lower Isimani groups further south. In addition, the data demonstrate that the Paleoproterozoic Usagaran orogeny has left a metamorphic imprint in the Neoproterozoic Mozambique Belt.

# Geological Setting of the Konse Group Marbles

## 3. Geological Setting of the Konse Group Marbles
The wedge-shaped area of the Paleoproterozoic Usagaran Belt at the SE corner of the Tanzania Craton (Fig. 1) was mapped and subdivided by earlier authors (Fig. 2; Meinhold, 1968, 1970; Meinhold and Frisch, 1970; Meinhold and Ott, 1993; Whittingham, 1959; Temperley, 1938; Mruma, 1989, 1995; Fritz et al., 2005 and references therein). Meinhold (1970) distinguished the high-grade Isimani Group (’Usagaran highly metamorphic rocks’ of Whittingham, 1959) and the lower-grade KG metasediments, which unconformably overlie migmatitic gneisses of the Archean Tanzania Craton (Fig. 2). The KG is overlain by the Lower Isimani Group, which consists of various types of metasediments. The low-P granulites (Grt-Crd-Sil) of the Upper Isimani Group rest on the top of the Lower Isimani Group (Fig. 2; Meinhold, 1970) and are restricted to the southern part of the map area (Fig. 2). They are regarded as a nappe, due to the different tectonic settings.

## Abstract
The study investigates the metamorphic history of the Konse Group (KG) in the context of the Usagaran orogeny, dated to approximately 2.0 Ga. The KG exhibits significant lithological variability, with evidence of initial rifting and subsequent metamorphism. Monazite dating of micaschists from Mhumbirisa Hill provides insights into the timing of metamorphism, indicating a lower amphibolite-facies metamorphism related to the Usagaran orogeny.

## 1. Introduction
The Konse Group (KG) is a geological formation that has undergone significant metamorphism during the Usagaran orogeny. This paper aims to elucidate the metamorphic processes and the geological history of the KG, particularly focusing on the lithological variations and the implications for understanding the tectonic evolution of the region.

## 2. Geological Setting
### 2.1. Lithological Variability
The KG is characterized by a complex succession of rock types, including quartzites, metavolcanic intercalations, and various metamorphic rocks. The lateral variability in lithological content is evident from detailed geological mapping conducted by Meinhold (1970) and Mruma (1995).

### 2.2. Metamorphic History
The metamorphic history of the KG is closely linked to the Usagaran orogeny, with evidence suggesting that the metamorphism occurred during the continent–continent collision at around 2.0 Ga. The presence of eclogites at Yalumba Hill indicates high-pressure conditions during this period.

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1. Sampling Strategy
For monazite dating, two samples of Mn3+-rich-andalusite-spessartine micaschists were collected from Mhumbirisa Hill. The samples were selected based on their stratigraphic context and mineral assemblages.

### 3.2. Analytical Techniques
The monazite grains were analyzed using in-situ techniques to determine their ages and to understand the metamorphic conditions. The Th-Pb dating method was employed to obtain precise age estimates.

## 4. Results
### 4.1. Monazite Dating
The weighted average age of monazite from the micaschists is 2028 ± 15 Ma, indicating that the lower amphibolite-facies metamorphism is related to the Usagaran orogeny. This finding suggests that the deposition of the Konse Group occurred prior to this metamorphic event.

### 4.2. Lithological Description
The KG succession includes a variety of rock types, such as quartzites, metaconglomerates, and micaschists. The basal quartzite exhibits several horizons of coarse-grained conglomerates, while the overlying mafic rocks show only weak metamorphic effects.

## 5. Discussion
The results of the monazite dating provide critical insights into the timing of metamorphism in the KG. The high Mn2O3 content in andalusite suggests a stabilization of this mineral relative to kyanite, which is found in the overlying Lower Isimani Group. The implications of these findings for the tectonic evolution of the region are discussed in detail.

## 6. Conclusion
The study concludes that the Konse Group underwent significant metamorphism during the Usagaran orogeny, with monazite dating providing a clear timeline for these events. The lithological variability within the KG reflects complex geological processes that warrant further investigation.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1. Monazite Dating
Monazite geochronology by SIMS using the CAMECA IMS 1280-HR at the Heidelberg University followed procedures described in Catlos et al. (2020). In brief, high-energy secondary ions were selectively analyzed by applying a 40 V offset to the 10 kV extraction potential. This mitigates matrix-dependent bias in relative sensitivities of the geochronologically relevant ion species. The mass table (with offsets indicated) included 143Nd232Th16O2, 204Pb, 206Pb (40 V), 207Pb (40 V), 208Pb (40 V), 208Pb (0 V), 232Th (40 V), 238U (40 V), 238UO (40 V), 232ThO2 (40 V), and 232ThO2 (0 V). Primary ions (16O-) were generated in a duoplasmatron source and shaped by the primary beam mass filter aperture to a ~3 nA oval spot with ~10 × 15 μm diameter and a total impact energy of 23 keV. The secondary column was tuned for high transmission using a 400 μm contrast aperture, a 3000 μm field aperture, a transfer magnification of 60×, and the XY-mode to achieve a mass resolving power (M/ΔM = 5000). After a 30 s presputter with a 15 × 15 μm raster, secondary ion intensities were detected on the axial electron multiplier in peak-hopping mode (waiting and counting times are in Supplementary Data Table S1) and corrected for dead-time. Interfering counts from 144Nd232Th16O2 on 204Pb used for the common-Pb correction were subtracted using the measured 143Nd-isotopologue and multiplied with a factor to adjust them to the intensities for Pb ions detected with the 40 V offset, which were calculated from the 208Pb intensities measured with and without offset. Relative sensitivities for Pb and Th were calibrated using a linear regression against ThO2/Th for repeated analysis of reference monazites 554, Amelia, and 44,069 with input ages of 45, 274.6, and 424.9 Ma, respectively (Harrison et al., 1999; Aleinikoff et al., 2006; Peterman et al. 2012).

### 2.2. Carbon and Oxygen Isotope Analysis of Carbonate Samples
Outcrop samples were cut with a diamond saw and polished to obtain fresh surfaces. Based on the three-step staining method (Dickson, 1965), using 1.5 % HCl, alizarine red S, and potassium ferricyanide, marble mineralogy (calcite vs. dolomite) was determined. After rinsing the polished surfaces with deionized-H2O, least-altered portions were micro-drilled with a diamond drill-bit. Carbonate carbon (δ13Ccarb) and oxygen (δ18Ocarb) isotope analysis was carried out at the Stable Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory at the University of California, Riverside, USA, using a GasBench II device connected to a Thermo Scientific Delta V Advantage isotope-ratio mass-spectrometer (IRMS) in a continuous-flow mode. The micro-drilled powders were reacted with phosphoric acid in a glass tube at 50 °C for 24 h before the analysis. Two international standards, NBS 18 and NBS 19, and one calibrated internal dolomite standard (Tytyri, δ13C = +0.78 ‰ V-PDB and δ18O = 7.07 ‰ V-PDB; Karhu, 1993) were analyzed along with the unknown samples to calibrate isotope data and correct oxygen isotope values for dolomitic marble samples. δ13Ccarb and δ18Ocarb values are reported in standard delta notation relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (V-PDB). Analytical precision was 0.1 ‰ (1σ) for δ13Ccarb and 0.2 ‰ (1σ) for δ18Ocarb based on repeated analyses of standards.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Monazite Ages
The age of metamorphism of the KG was determined by analyzing 7 monazite grains from two samples of Mn3+-rich-andalusite-spessartine micaschists (T110-14-93; T110-15-93). The rare monazite grains (2–11 grains per thin section) were analyzed in situ in the two samples (i.e., in petrographic context of thin sections) from the same locality (T110-93 in Figs. 2 and 3a). The grains are concentrically or patchy zoned, which is visible as brighter and darker zones in backscattered electron (BSE) images (Fig. 4c and d). The monazite SIMS analyses determined that all grains of the two samples are essentially free of U (Th/U of 1–8 x 10^5; Tables 1 and S1) and only 208Pb/232Th ages are therefore reported.

## Abstract
The metamorphic age of the KG is determined to be 2028 ± 15 Ma, which is attributed to the Usagaran orogeny. This finding contradicts previous interpretations of the KG as a post-Usagaran basin. The absence of U in analyzed metamorphic monazite grains is linked to oxidizing depositional conditions. The stable isotope compositions of marbles from the KG and Mpwapwa Group reveal significant variations in δ13Ccarb and δ18O values, indicating a complex history of metamorphism and sedimentation.

## 1. Introduction
The study focuses on the geological history of the KG and its relationship to the Usagaran orogeny. Previous interpretations suggested a post-orogenic deposition, which this study aims to refute by providing new isotopic data.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Sample Collection
Samples were collected from various locations within the KG and Mpwapwa Group.

### 2.2 Isotope Analysis
Stable isotope compositions were analyzed using standard techniques to determine δ13Ccarb and δ18O values.

## 3. Results
### 3.1 Metamorphic Age
The metamorphic age of the KG is established at 2028 ± 15 Ma (MSWD = 0.2; n = 10). This age supports the association of the KG with the Usagaran orogeny.

### 3.2 Isotope Compositions
The KG marbles exhibit δ13Ccarb values ranging from +0.3 to +12.6 ‰ V-PDB and δ18O values from 19.7 to 7.7 ‰ V-PDB. The Mpwapwa Group samples show a wider spread in both δ13Ccarb and δ18O values.

#### Table 1: Isotope Data for KG and Mpwapwa Group Marbles
| Sample Location | δ13Ccarb (‰ V-PDB) | δ18O (‰ V-PDB) |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| KG               | +0.3 to +12.6      | 19.7 to 7.7     |
| Mpwapwa Group    | +6.5 to +9.3       | 25.1 to 7.0     |

## 4. Discussion
The positive δ13Ccarb values in the KG and Mpwapwa Group marbles are interpreted as primary sedimentary signatures, indicating deposition during the Lomagundi Carbon Isotope Excursion (LCIE). The isotopic data suggest that the KG represents a passive continental margin succession deposited prior to the Usagaran orogeny.

## 5. Conclusion
The findings of this study provide new insights into the geological history of the KG and its relationship to the Usagaran orogeny. The isotopic signatures indicate that the KG and Mpwapwa Group marbles were deposited during a significant geological event, the LCIE, which has implications for understanding the sedimentary processes of the time.

### 3.1 Secular Carbon Isotope Variations
Secular carbon isotope variations in seawater and redox indicators for the oxidation state of the early Paleoproterozoic atmosphere–ocean system (modified from Bekker, 2022a). Four blue vertical bars mark Paleoproterozoic glacial events; the dashed secular carbon isotope curve between 2.5 and 2.22 Ga emphasizes the uncertainty in this part of the curve; red-filled shape is the Wooly Dolomite excursion; the dashed bar for marine sulfate evaporites after ~ 2.06 Ga indicates that sulfate evaporites again became rare in the Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic records after that time.

Deposition of iron formations and Mn-rich deposits indicates anoxic conditions in deep waters. While deposition of iron formations does not necessarily require atmospheric oxygen and can be mediated by anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, Mn oxidation requires significant levels of atmospheric oxygen. Mn deposition largely decoupled from iron deposition, started at the beginning of the GOE and continued at least until the aftermath of the LCIE.

Within this framework, the likely depositional age of the Konse Group sediments falls into the interval of ca. 2.22–2.0 Ga defined by the beginning of the LCIE and the Usagaran Orogeny. These 220 Ma represent a maximum estimate for the duration of the sedimentation, but most likely the Konse Group deposition took much less time. The highly positive carbon isotope values for the Konse and Mpwapwa groups potentially indicate deposition during the peak of the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion at ca. 2.15 Ga and its duration was less than the mean lifetime of Phanerozoic passive margins of ~ 134 million years (Bradley, 2008).

### 3.2 Geological Context
The orogenies of the Magondi and Limpopo belts of Zimbabwe are of the same age as the Usagaran orogeny (ca. 2.0 Ga; Treloar, 1988; Buick et al., 2003; Kramers and Mouri, 2011; Glynn, 2017; Glynn et al., 2020). Although the age of the orogeny in the Ruwenzori Fold Belt is poorly constrained, zircon ages for granulite and granite also point to this time span of 2.1–1.9 Ga (Manttari et al., 2011).

The Ruwenzori Fold Belt includes large volumes of mafic rocks, which are in part pillow basalts of MORB geochemical affinity and are associated with marbles and meta-siliciclastic units of the Buganda Group. These mafic rocks indicate an extensive Paleoproterozoic ocean that separated the Tanzania Craton from the Archean basement of northern Uganda (Tanner, 1970; Barth and Meinhold, 1974).

However, the occurrence of eclogites, like those in the Usagaran Orogen, has not been reported so far. Other well-known, comparable Paleoproterozoic passive continental margin successions developed around Archean cratons are the Coronation Supergroup in the Wopmay Orogen (Slave Craton, NW Canada; Hoffman, 1973; Hoffman and Bowring, 1984) and the lower Minas Supergroup of the São Francisco Craton (Bekker et al., 2003b; Alkmim and Teixeira, 2017).

By identifying the Konse and Mpwapwa groups as passive continental margin successions deposited on the Tanzania Craton, the Usagaran Orogen stands out by uniquely preserving lithological vestiges of a complete Wilson cycle. The beginning of the Usagaran Wilson cycle is currently unconstrained because a corresponding rift succession has neither been described nor dated.

## 3. Results
### 3.1 Geological Context
The marbles of the KG are associated with highly oxidized meta-sediments (Mn-rich andalusite-spessartine micaschists, piemontite-quartzites; Fig. 3a) containing Mn3+-bearing minerals such as Mn3+-rich andalusite and piemontite. All monazite grains of the two dated Mn-rich micaschist samples lack significant U abundances (Tables 1 and S1), which points to oxidizing conditions in the precursor sediments, at least since the growth of monazite grains during metamorphism, but most likely already since its sedimentation.

### 3.2 Isotope Analysis
The isotope analysis of the KG marbles from all stratigraphic levels revealed the dominance of highly positive δ13Ccarb values (>+5‰ V-PDB and up to +12.6 ‰), which indicate sedimentation during the Paleoproterozoic Lomagundi Carbon Isotope Excursion, a worldwide chemostratigraphic marker. This points to deposition of the KG during the time interval between ca. 2.22 and 2.06 Ga.

### 3.3 Tectonic Implications
The KG is interpreted as a passive continental margin succession and as such it represents an important lithological component of the Paleoproterozoic plate-tectonic Wilson cycle related to the Usagaran orogeny. The beginning of the Usagaran Wilson cycle is unconstrained, as a corresponding rift succession is not known. If the highest carbon isotope values of marbles from the Konse and Mpwapwa groups correspond to the peak of the LCIE at ca. 2.15 Ga ago (Bekker et al., 2003a), the lifetime of the Usagaran passive continental margin would be comparable to or slightly shorter than the mean lifespan of extinct Phanerozoic passive margins of ca. 134 million years (Bradley, 2008).

### 3.4 Comparison with Mpwapwa Group
The metasediments of the Mpwapwa Group (in the Kiboriani Mountains and at the Mautia Hill) are interpreted as the northern and eastern equivalents of the KG. They generally experienced their main metamorphism in the Paleoproterozoic and were also affected by a weaker Neoproterozoic overprint during the Kuunga event at ca. 550 Ma. High submarine hydrothermal and volcanic activity has been proposed to explain the Mn-enrichment in sediments of the broadly correlative Paleoproterozoic Francevillian basin (Gabon) on the western margin of the Congo Craton (e.g., Gauthier-Lafaye and Weber, 2003; Ossa Ossa et al., 2018).

## 4. Discussion
The isotopic compositions of the granulite-facies marbles in the Neoproterozoic Eastern Granulites of the Mozambique Belt are distinct from those of the Paleoproterozoic Konse and Mpwapwa Group marbles as they lack elevated δ13Ccarb values (>+5‰ V-PDB) characteristic of the LCIE. This difference cannot be explained by granulite-facies metamorphism as the LCIE has been recorded in the granulite-facies marbles (Baker and Fallick, 1989a; Baker and Fallick, 1989b).

According to the geodynamic model of Appel et al. (1998) and Moller et al. (2000), the Eastern Granulites experienced a counter-clockwise metamorphic P-T path (at ca. 650–600 Ma) in an active continental margin setting that was affected by magmatic activity between ca. 900 and 600 Ma ago (Moller et al., 2000). They were subsequently exhumed from the deep crust during the Kuunga event (ca. 550 Ma) when the granulites were thrust towards the Tanzania Craton and the Usagaran Orogen to the west.

## 5. Conclusion
Dating of metamorphic monazite from lower amphibolite-facies Mn3+-rich micaschists of the KG at the SE margin of the Tanzania Craton has established a ca. 2.03 Ga metamorphic age, which is related to the Usagaran orogeny. This age challenges the former interpretation that the KG was deposited in a post-orogenic basin near the craton margin on the top of folded Usagaran gneisses.

The Konse Group thus represents a cratonic passive margin succession, belonging to the Usagaran Orogen that contains several essential lithological members of a plate-tectonic Wilson cycle, which include eclogites that formed from ocean-floor basalts. This suggests that modern-style plate tectonics already operated during the early Paleoproterozoic.

# Paleoproterozoic Atmospheric, Biogeochemical, and Climactic Change

## Abstract
The study investigates the atmospheric, biogeochemical, and climatic changes during the Paleoproterozoic era, focusing on the implications of these changes for the evolution of early life and the Earth's environment.

## 1. Introduction
The Paleoproterozoic era, spanning from 2.5 to 1.6 billion years ago, is characterized by significant geological and biological transformations. This period witnessed the emergence of atmospheric oxygen, known as the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), which had profound effects on the Earth's biogeochemical cycles and climate. Understanding these changes is crucial for reconstructing the early Earth environment and the evolution of life.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Sample Collection
Fieldwork was conducted in Tanzania, where samples were collected from various geological formations. The samples were analyzed for isotopic compositions to infer the environmental conditions during the Paleoproterozoic.

### 2.2 Analytical Techniques
Stable isotope analyses were performed using SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) to determine carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios. These analyses provide insights into the biogeochemical processes occurring during the time.

## 3. Results
### 3.1 Isotopic Data
The isotopic data indicate significant fluctuations in carbon and oxygen levels, suggesting changes in atmospheric composition and biological activity. The results are consistent with the hypothesis of a gradual increase in atmospheric oxygen leading up to the GOE.

### 3.2 Geological Correlations
Geological correlations between the Pilbara and Kaapvaal cratons reveal a synchronous pattern of sedimentation and volcanic activity, supporting the idea of global climatic changes during the Paleoproterozoic.

## 4. Discussion
The findings suggest that the Paleoproterozoic was a dynamic period marked by significant atmospheric and climatic shifts. The increase in atmospheric oxygen likely facilitated the evolution of more complex life forms. Additionally, the data support the notion that tectonic activity played a crucial role in shaping the biogeochemical landscape of the time.

## 5. Conclusion
This study highlights the importance of understanding the Paleoproterozoic era's atmospheric and climatic changes. The evidence presented supports the idea that these changes were instrumental in the evolution of early life and the development of the Earth's environment.
