### Abstract
This chapter examined the alignment between the information prospective students gathered about the Open University of Tanzania (OUT) and their actual experiences. It identified the main sources through which students received first-hand information and analyzed the nature of this information in relation to OUT’s Open and Distance Learning (ODL) system. The chapter was developed through a literature review, case studies, and surveys. Data were collected using a questionnaire that included questions about academics, support services, and other important aspects of the university. The survey, conducted via Google Forms, involved 311 OUT students from various programs. Findings revealed that the OUT website was the primary source of information for prospective students, while other sources like radio, family members, career advisors, and TV commercials were rated much lower. Students reported receiving general information about OUT’s ODL model, but they expressed dissatisfaction with the information regarding the link between academic programs and career opportunities. Understanding these issues was essential for improving open, online, and distance learning and addressing barriers to successful ODL implementation. The chapter's findings contributed to refining marketing strategies and offered insights into future directions for ODL.

# Background of the Chapter

Every prospective student requires access to valuable information that will assist in determining their choice for higher learning. It is customary and anticipated for students to actively pursue information in order to narrow down their options and choose an institution that aligns with their expectations and interests. In light of the present and continuous evolution of the university marketplace, its operational methods, and the consequences for both students and universities, careful consideration is given to the crucial matter of whether first-hand information accurately represents the experience and satisfaction of the students. The prevailing assumption is that first-hand information consistently possesses a significant level of integrity, dependability, and accuracy.

Moreover, higher education institutions, including OUT, have an essential role in sustainability (Žalėnienė and Pereira, 2021). Wals (2014) indicates that the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (UNDESD) emphasizes the importance of education in increasing world sustainability. One of the objectives of UNDESD is "to integrate the principles, values and practices of sustainable development into all aspects of education and learning." Sustainability principles need to be at the heart of higher institutions' strategy and are key to being incorporated into the organisational culture. Higher education contributes decisively to the Sustainable Development Goals implementation, especially to Goal 1 (end poverty in all its forms everywhere), Goal 3 (ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages), Goal 5 (gender equality), Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth), Goal 12 (responsible consumption and production), Goal 13 (climate change) and Goal 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). In light of this context, the first-hand information that the OUT provides to potential students should be pertinent in addressing challenges associated with sustainable development.

Sterling (2001) poses two fundamental enquiries regarding sustainable education: "What is the purpose of education?" and "Whose Education?" Starting with the first question, this is all about the purpose of education: to replicate society and culture and promote citizenship (socialisation function); to train people for employment (vocational function); to develop the individual and their potential (liberal function); and to encourage change towards a fairer society and better world (transformative function). Another question is about "whose education"? Education seeks to place ownership and determination with educators, learners, and communities. Learners should have ownership of their learning, and education has to be meaningful, engaging and participative rather than functional, passive and prescriptive. This chapter concentrated on the...

# Abstract
The significance of first-hand information in enabling prospective students to access sustainable education for successful Open, online, and distance Learning (ODL) is crucial. This study explores how information gathering influences the decision-making process of students considering enrollment at the Open University of Tanzania (OUT).

# 1. Introduction
The choice of which university to attend is characterized as a highly complex decision influenced by multiple factors (Briggs and Wilson, 2007). Complete information about an institution allows prospective students to make informed educational decisions. McNicholas (2020) highlights that information seeking is a key factor influencing students' decisions to attend any university. The process of choosing a university involves substantial decision-making within the context of information inquiry. Prospective students seek first-hand information, expecting it to provide a transparent and accurate depiction of university life.

# 2. Methodology
Information collection reduces uncertainty, as per Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) (Spink and Cole, 2004). CDT elucidates the role of information in reducing individuals' uncertainty regarding information searching and decision-making (Blythe, 2013). The theory posits that individuals may attempt to mitigate dissonance by modifying their perspectives in response to new information that enhances consistency or congruence. Blythe (2013) identified four types of perceived risk that incite prospective students to gather information prior to making a decision, thereby boosting their confidence in undertaking a study.

## 2.1 Information Gathering Risks
Figure 1 illustrates the four types of risks: psychosocial, financial, physical, and functional.

### Figure 1: Information gathering risks reduction and decision-making processes adapted from McNicholas (2020).

# 3. Results
The decision regarding which university to attend and which course to pursue is a challenging task for prospective students. Ürer et al. (2021) note that students seek information to alleviate the anxiety associated with choosing a higher education institution. Information search is considered a means used by consumers, where consumers are defined as prospective students (Urbany et al., 1989; Cox, 1967). Information searching is recognized as the second stage in the decision-making process, as defined by Kotler and Fox (1995).

# 4. Discussion
The findings suggest that the complexity of the decision-making process for prospective students is significantly influenced by the availability and quality of information. The reduction of perceived risks through effective information gathering can lead to more confident decision-making.

# 5. Conclusion
In conclusion, first-hand information plays a vital role in the decision-making process for prospective students. Understanding the types of risks involved and the importance of information seeking can enhance the educational choices made by students.

# Needs Recognition and Evaluation Process in Higher Education

## Abstract
The process of selecting an institution for higher education involves several stages, including needs recognition and evaluation. This paper explores the factors influencing students' decisions to enroll in programs at the Open University of Tanzania (OUT), highlighting the role of information dissemination and marketing strategies.

## 1. Introduction
The initial stage in the decision-making process for prospective students is needs recognition. This stage encompasses the selection of an institution, motivation to study, and the selection of relevant information. Following this, students engage in an evaluation process, which involves assessing various institutions based on their perceived risks and benefits.

## 2. Methodology
This study employs a qualitative approach to analyze the information dissemination strategies of the Open University of Tanzania. Data was collected through interviews with marketing officers and an analysis of enrollment statistics.

## 3. Results
### 3.1 Admission Trends
As illustrated in Figure 2, the OUT admits students to a variety of programs at different levels, including PhDs, Masters', Postgraduate Diplomas, Bachelor's degrees, Diplomas, and certificates. The admission trend indicates an increase in student enrollment over five years, with a slight decrease in student admission in 2019/2020.

| 2020/2021         | 3000                        |
| 2021/2022         | 2000                        |

## 4. Discussion
The regional centres of OUT are staffed by marketing officers who operate under the Communication and Marketing Department. Their primary role is to promote OUT programs and ensure that the institution attracts students annually. They provide essential information regarding the programs offered, academic issues, school fees, and the Open and Distance Learning (ODL) system during the marketing process. Additionally, marketing officers address inquiries that arise during the marketing procedure, tailoring their dissemination of information to the demographic being targeted.

## 5. Conclusion
The findings indicate that effective information dissemination and marketing strategies are crucial for attracting students to the Open University of Tanzania. Understanding the needs recognition and evaluation processes can enhance the institution's ability to meet prospective students' expectations and improve enrollment rates.

# METHODOLOGY

A questionnaire was developed through Google Forms, which captured the specific objectives regarding the information about OUT. A total of 311 students currently enrolled at OUT responded to a questionnaire online. The questionnaire contained information regarding first-hand information sources in which students were required to indicate an option of their favour. The students were also provided with statements on issues related to academics, supporting services, and related matters, as well as issues regarding the OUT as an ODL institution. The statements were rated using five levels of the Likert scale in search of students' agreement on the information provided. In order to analyse data, Microsoft Excel was implemented. The obtained information from the questionnaire were loaded to the Excel sheet, percentages were computed for gender, age, and sources of information regarding the OUT. Additionally, the percentages were also calculated for the statements concerning the actuality of OUT, along with Likert scale levels. Subsequently, bar charts were implemented to visually represent the findings.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

This part of the book chapter presents the results on gender and age of the students participated in the study. Also, the section presents results regarding sources for first-hand information, nature of the first-hand information about the University and first-hand information about OUT and the mode of study.

The data presented in Figure 3 demonstrates that a sizeable proportion of the individuals who participated in this book chapter were male.

## 3. Results
### 3.1 Demographic Information
Figure 3 shows that the majority of respondents to the questionnaire were aged 25-34 (53.4%) and 35-44 (36.3%). The results revealed that individuals who enroll in the University fall within the age range of 25 to 44 years. Moreover, there are few individuals aged 45 and above. The students who participated in the development of this chapter presented the faculties and directorates of the OUT.

Students from the faculty of education accounted for 39.1%, the faculty of law 5.8%, the faculty of arts and social sciences 33.3%, the faculty of science 9.2%, and the Institute of Continuing Education (ICE) 12.6%. Out of the 311 responses, 11.7% were from master's programs, 60.9% were from first degrees, 14.8% were from diplomas, 9.1% were from certificates, and 3.5% were from postgraduate diplomas.

Students were also from different academic years, whereby 35.1% were in their first year of study, 31.2% were in their second year, 29.9% were in their third year, 1.3% were in their fourth year, 0.9% in their fifth year, 0.9% in their sixth year, and 0.9% in their seventh year.

## 4. Sources for First-Hand Information
This section identifies key information sources that students visited when they decided to study with the OUT. It is imperative to comprehend the significance of first-hand sources when investigating the manner in which prospective students acquire information about universities. Kotler (2008), as indicated in Figure 4, divides these external information sources into two categories: personal and non-personal.

Non-personal sources consist of advertisements, prospectuses, and mass media, while personal sources include advice from family, friends, and instructors. Non-personal sources comprise more formal methods of information dissemination, including promotional materials and official university websites. Information sources have been classified as impersonal and personal (Patti and Chen, 2009), direct, media, and social (Bonnema &#x26; van der Waldt, 2008), or online and offline (Patti and Chen, 2009; Dao &#x26; Thorpe, 2015).

The information sources illustrate students' direct methods of gathering information regarding their prospective educational institutions. These sources provide valuable, intimate insights and can have a substantial impact on the decision-making process of a prospective student. By integrating these diverse sources of information, prospective students can achieve a more nuanced understanding of what a university has to offer, enabling them to make well-informed decisions about their educational paths.

Thus, students have access to a variety of information sources from which they can obtain first-hand information before deciding whether or not to pursue higher education at a certain institution, as illustrated in Figure 4.

[Abstract content not provided in the current text.]

## 2. Introduction
[Introduction content not provided in the current text.]

## 3. Methodology
[Methodology content not provided in the current text.]

## 4. Results
### 4.1 Information Sources
Figure 5 indicates the information sources students visited prior to studying with the OUT. The findings of this chapter reveal that prospective students mostly use the website (40%) to search for information about OUT in order to decide whether or not to pursue further education. Moreover, the findings revealed other sources of information prospective students rely on, including an OUT prospectus (20.40%) and information from a friend (20%). However, the findings also revealed that some sources of information are rarely visited, such as career advisors (1%), OUT regional centre (2%), radio (5.3%), TV commercials (5.3%), and family members (6%). This was a surprising finding.

### 4.2 Nature of the First-Hand Information about the University
It is of the utmost importance to provide prospective students with accurate and relevant information pertaining to the University. Prospective students are always on the lookout for detailed university information so they may make educated decisions. They do not simply accept the information; they evaluate its relevance in relation to their circumstances, personal objectives, and values (Lubbe and Petzer 2013). The quality and scope of this information can vary substantially depending on the sources queried and the individual's background, which may include personal experiences and prior knowledge. The information provided about a university must be comprehensive and detailed despite these variations. A comprehensive presentation of information assists candidates in making well-informed decisions regarding their academic future and addresses knowledge deficits. In this chapter, students at the Open University of Tanzania have exhibited specific insights into the quality and nature of the information that has been presented to them. The students were provided with statements which showed the quality of the information about OUT.

## Results
It is also mentioned in this chapter that the kind of general information that is anticipated to be offered by the OUT to potential students in relation to their decision to enrol in the University is presented as indicated in Figure 6. Nine out of ten statements regarding the information were agreed to be provided by the information sources. Furthermore, there was a solid agreement regarding the information on the admissions process being completely explicit. According to Figure 6, statements on the link between academic issues, career goals and qualifications and career opportunities were strongly disagreed. The findings imply that students are not satisfied with the information provided.

## Discussion
### First-hand information about OUT and the mode of study
The Open University of Tanzania is distinguished by its emphasis on Open and Distance Learning (ODL) and its distinctive educational approach within the country. Its flexibility and accessibility are the distinguishing characteristics of Open and Distance Learning (ODL). ODL is an optimal option for students who are unable to attend traditional classroom settings due to personal, professional, or geographical obligations, as it enables them to study from virtually any location and at any time. In order to facilitate education, this method frequently employs online platforms, printed materials, and intermittent in-person interactions. The focus is on self-directed learning, in which students are empowered to manage their schedules and progress with the assistance of digital resources and remote tutoring.

# Abstract
The study investigates the sources of information utilized by prospective students when considering enrollment in the Open University (OUT) and the impact of these sources on their expectations and decisions. The findings indicate that students predominantly rely on the university's website for accurate and comprehensive information regarding their future experiences.

# 1. Introduction
The decision-making process for prospective students is heavily influenced by the information they receive about the institution. This study aims to explore the characteristics of the online distance learning (ODL) style of study and how the information provided aligns with students' expectations.

# 2. Methodology
The research employed a qualitative approach, gathering data through surveys and interviews with prospective students. The focus was on understanding the sources of information they utilized and their perceptions of the accuracy and relevance of this information.

# 3. Results
## 3.1 Information Sources
The results reveal that the university website is the primary source of information for prospective students. The OUT Information and Communication Technology Policy (2019/20 to 2023/24) emphasizes the importance of providing users with pertinent and up-to-date information.

## 3.2 Student Expectations
Students expect the information provided to be authentic and comprehensive. The findings suggest that the website has been improved to meet these expectations, incorporating a live support feature for enhanced communication.

# 4. Discussion
The study highlights the significance of the university's website as a communication and marketing tool. The organization and presentation of information on the website play a crucial role in shaping students' perceptions and expectations. The findings align with previous studies, such as those by Ürer et al. (2021) and Paddy (2019), which emphasize the importance of reliable information sources in the decision-making process for prospective students.

# 5. Conclusion
The information provided by OUT is critical in influencing prospective students' decisions. Ensuring that the website contains accurate and comprehensive information is essential for fostering an environment that meets students' expectations.

# Abstract
This chapter examines the role of first-hand information about the Open University of Tanzania (OUT) in facilitating sustainable education through open, online, and distance learning (ODL). It highlights the importance of clear and accessible information for prospective students in making informed decisions regarding their academic pursuits. The findings indicate that the OUT's website serves as a primary source of information, which is crucial for understanding the application process, admission choices, and the ODL mode of study.

# 1. Introduction
Prospective students' information is crucial when deciding to study with the OUT. Clear information unlocks sustainable education as it allows prospective students to choose courses that align with their career goals and opportunities. However, the information regarding the link between academic issues and career opportunities appears to be unsatisfactory for students. Bae (2022) noted the relationship between academic issues and career opportunities, emphasizing that understanding this link helps prospective students meet their needs.

# 2. Methodology
The chapter employs a qualitative approach to analyze the information provided by the OUT and its impact on prospective students. It examines the characteristics of OUT's ODL method of study and how these characteristics influence students' decisions to study with OUT.

## 2.1 Challenges Faced by Students
Prospective students must be aware of the characteristics of ODL, as they mitigate challenges faced during their studies. Edward (2019) highlighted that rural ODL students encounter issues such as limited study places and unstable electricity, which can disrupt concentration and engagement with course material. These challenges exacerbate the digital divide and hinder academic success for rural students compared to their urban counterparts.

# 3. Results
The findings reveal that the OUT's website is the primary source of information for prospective students, underscoring its critical role in facilitating accessibility to education. The information provided reflects the reality of the OUT regarding application processes, admission choices, and the ODL mode of study.

# 4. Discussion
The chapter discusses the implications of the findings, emphasizing that prioritizing accessible and reliable information minimizes barriers to successful ODL implementation. It meets the needs of applicants and provides a clear understanding of the academic journey at OUT. Furthermore, if first-hand information does not accurately reflect the reality of OUT programs, it may negatively impact institutional development by limiting the number of students interested in joining OUT. The quality of first-hand information significantly influences the reputation and image of the University.

# 5. Conclusion
In conclusion, the chapter highlights the importance of clear and accurate information for prospective students at OUT. It emphasizes that effective communication of the ODL characteristics and the realities of the academic journey is essential for attracting and retaining students, thereby contributing to sustainable education.

# CONCLUSION
The purpose of this chapter is to analyse whether or not first-hand information may be applied to the actual situation of OUT. In this chapter, the OUT website is the central source of information. Nevertheless, the reality of OUT is represented in the nature of the general information about OUT, which is comparable to that of other institutions; however, the nature of the first-hand information should not be the end of information that distinguishes OUT as an online and distance learning institution.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
The OUT website and other information sources should be improved periodically to include information regarding the link to academic issues, career opportunities, and goals that show not satisfying the prospective students' needs.

Other sources of information that have been rated low have to be examined to see if the information contained in or provided, like those from regional centres and TV commercials, suffice the needs and expectations of the prospective students towards the choice to study at the OUT. A study needs to be conducted to identify the information deficiencies in the sources that hinder prospective students' engagement in deciding to enrol at the OUT.
