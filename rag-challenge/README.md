# 🤖 Phase 2: RAG Implementation Challenge

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

Build an intelligent Q&A system for academic research papers using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Transform your parsed documents from Phase 1 into a searchable knowledge base that can answer complex research questions with accurate, contextual responses.

### Basic ChromaDB RAG 🗄️

**File**: `strategy1_chromadb_basic.ipynb`

- **Philosophy**: Vector storage with semantic search using ChromaDB
- **Components**: Document chunking → Embeddings → Vector store → Retrieval → Generation
- **Strengths**: Simple setup, local storage, good performance baseline
- **Optimization Areas**: Chunk strategies, embedding models, retrieval parameters

## 📊 Input Requirements

### Prerequisites from Phase 1

You **must** complete the parsing challenge first and have:

- Parsed markdown files in `../data/input_papers/`
- Clean, structured academic content
- Preserved citations and section hierarchies
- RAG-optimized text chunks

### Available Parsed Papers

- `strategy1_banana_llamaparse.md` - Mobile-Based Deep Learning Models for Banana Disease
- Additional parsed markdown files from your Phase 1 outputs

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Core Requirements

✅ **Vector database created** from parsed documents  
✅ **Semantic search implemented** with relevant retrieval  
✅ **Question-answering system** generating accurate responses  
✅ **Citation preservation** in generated answers

### Quality Metrics

- **Retrieval Accuracy** (30%) - Relevant chunk identification
- **Answer Quality** (35%) - Generated response accuracy and coherence
- **Context Preservation** (35%) - Academic context and citation maintenance

## 🛠️ Requirements

### API Keys (in `.env` file)

```bash
# Choose your preferred LLM provider
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key-here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here

# Optional: Model and provider overrides for RAG system
LLM_PROVIDER=openai   # Options: openai, gemini, anthropic
LLM_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo  # e.g., gpt-4, gemini-pro, claude-3
LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.1
LLM_MAX_TOKENS=1000
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

1. **Complete Phase 1** parsing challenge first
2. **Open the notebook**: `strategy1_chromadb_basic.ipynb`
3. **Set up API keys** and dependencies
4. **Load parsed documents** from Phase 1 outputs
5. **Run baseline RAG implementation**
6. **Test with sample questions**
7. **Implement optimizations** for your use case

## 🧩 RAG Pipeline Components

### 1. Document Processing & Chunking

```python
# Smart chunking strategies
- Semantic chunking (sentence boundaries)
- Fixed-size with overlap
- Section-based chunking (academic structure)
- Hierarchical chunking (multi-level)
```

### 2. Embedding & Vector Storage

```python
# Embedding model options
- sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2  # Fast, good baseline
- sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2  # Better accuracy
- text-embedding-ada-002  # OpenAI (API required)
- Custom fine-tuned models  # Domain-specific
```

### 3. Retrieval Strategies

```python
# Retrieval approaches
- Similarity search (cosine, dot product)
- Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
- Multi-query retrieval
- Parent-child document retrieval
```

### 4. Generation & Response Synthesis

```python
# LLM options for generation
- OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-3.5  # High quality, API required
- Anthropic Claude  # Excellent reasoning, API required
- Together AI models  # Open source options
- Local models (Llama, Mistral)  # Privacy-focused
```

## 💡 Optimization Strategies

### ChromaDB RAG Optimizations

#### Quick Wins (15-30 minutes)

- **Chunk Size Tuning**: Test 200, 500, 1000 character chunks
- **Overlap Optimization**: 10-20% overlap between chunks
- **Embedding Model**: Try different sentence-transformers models
- **Retrieval Count**: Adjust k=3,5,10 retrieved documents

#### Medium Effort (1-2 hours)

- **Metadata Filtering**: Add paper, section, figure metadata
- **Semantic Chunking**: Split on sentence/paragraph boundaries
- **Query Enhancement**: Rephrase user questions for better retrieval
- **Response Templates**: Structure answers with citations

#### High Impact (2-4 hours)

- **Hierarchical Storage**: Multi-level document representation
- **Custom Embeddings**: Fine-tune models on academic content
- **Re-ranking**: Score and reorder retrieved chunks
- **Multi-modal Search**: Combine text and metadata signals

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

## 🧪 Testing Framework

### Sample Academic Questions

Test your RAG system with questions like:

**Basic Factual**

- "What is the main research question in the ResearchGate paper?"
- "How many participants were in the Schenk study?"

**Analytical**

- "What are the key differences between the two methodologies?"
- "What limitations do the authors identify in their approach?"

**Synthesis**

- "How do these papers relate to each other?"
- "What future research directions are suggested?"

**Citation-Based**

- "Which studies are cited most frequently?"
- "What evidence supports the main conclusions?"

## 🔍 Validation Checklist

Before considering the challenge complete:

- [ ] **Vector Database**: Successfully created and populated
- [ ] **Search Functionality**: Returns relevant results for test queries
- [ ] **Answer Generation**: Produces coherent, accurate responses

## 🎪 Common Challenges & Solutions

### Poor Retrieval Quality

- **Problem**: Irrelevant chunks retrieved for queries
- **Solutions**: Better embeddings, query enhancement, metadata filtering

### Hallucinated Responses

- **Problem**: Generated answers contain false information
- **Solutions**: Stricter prompts, retrieval validation, confidence scoring

### Slow Performance

- **Problem**: Long response times for queries
- **Solutions**: Vector optimization, caching, async processing

### Citation Issues

- **Problem**: Incorrect or missing source attribution
- **Solutions**: Enhanced metadata, citation-aware prompts, verification systems

## 🏁 Success Indicators & Next Steps

### Completion Criteria

1. **Functional RAG system** answering academic questions
2. **Accurate retrieval** finding relevant document sections
3. **Quality responses** with proper citations

### Beyond the Challenge
